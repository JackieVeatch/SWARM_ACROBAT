# SWARM_ACROBAT
code for creating phytoplankton patch identification from towed ACROBAT data for the NSF funded project SWARM 2020 field season

two versions: '5m' denoted the version that defines phytoplankton patches by integrating to a constant 5m depth, the other integrating to that profile's mixed layer depth.

ACROBAT data initially quality controlled with: Reister, I. 2023. isreister/ACROBAT: v1.0.0\_UAFOceansACROBAT. v1.0.0UAF\_ACROBAT edn. Zenodo. 10.5281/zenodo.7768458 https://zenodo.org/record/7768458#.ZB39hnbMJaQ
